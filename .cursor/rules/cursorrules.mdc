# Required MCP Runners
You must use the following runners for all code execution, environment setup, or testing:

`context7-mcp` (v1.0.0+): For all general-purpose tasks and context-aware workflows.
`server-sequential-thinking` (v2.x): For sequential backend task orchestration.
`vercel` (latest): For project deployment, group access, and artifact checks.
`supabase` (v1.5.0+): For project creation, migrations, edge functions, and database operations.
`browsermcp` (v3.2.0+): For browser-based automated testing and simulation.

# Usage Requirements
Whenever you attempt a task like:
- creating a project
- modifying environment or deployment
- running integration or browser tests
- pushing updates to Vercel or Supabase
You must run the corresponding command using `npx` like below (examples):
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest run @upstash/context7-mcp
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest run @smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking
npx -y --package @vercel/sdk -- mcp start --bearer-token ...
npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest start --project-id <project-id>
npx @browsermcp/mcp@latest run-test --scenario <scenario-name>
Do not bypass or skip these commands unless explicitly instructed.
If the required tool is not available or the command fails, stop and ask for clarification before proceeding.
Your code and reasoning must assume the infrastructure and tools above are always in use.
# Note
These tools encapsulate our organization's compliance, reliability, and workflow standards.
